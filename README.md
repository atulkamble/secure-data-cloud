**Project: Secure Data in the Cloud**

### Overview
This project focuses on securing data in the cloud using Azure services. Key areas covered include data encryption, key management strategies (Platform Managed Keys and Customer Managed Keys), and an understanding of Azure Key Vaultâ€™s features and benefits. By the end of this project, you will be able to manage keys, secrets, and certificates effectively and implement soft delete and purge protection to enhance cloud security.

### **Steps to Complete the Project**

#### **1. Understand Data Encryption Basics**
   - Research the importance of encrypting data in transit and at rest.
   - Study the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
   - Explore scenarios where data encryption is essential in the cloud.

#### **2. Learn About Platform Managed Key (PMK) and Customer Managed Key (CMK)**
   - **Platform Managed Key (PMK):**
     - Understand how Azure manages encryption keys on behalf of users.
     - Explore scenarios where PMK is sufficient.
   - **Customer Managed Key (CMK):**
     - Learn how users can bring and manage their encryption keys.
     - Review requirements for CMK in Azure.

#### **3. Deep Dive into Azure Key Vault**
   - **Azure Key Vault Overview:**
     - Understand what Azure Key Vault is and its role in cloud security.
     - Study how Key Vault integrates with Azure services.
   - **Benefits of Azure Key Vault:**
     - Centralized management of keys, secrets, and certificates.
     - Enhanced security through controlled access and auditing.

#### **4. Set Up Azure Key Vault**
   - Create an Azure Key Vault using the Azure portal.
   - Assign users and applications to the Key Vault with appropriate permissions.

#### **5. Implement Key, Secret, and Certificate Management**
   - **Key Management:**
     - Create and manage encryption keys in Azure Key Vault.
     - Set up automatic key rotation policies.
   - **Secrets Management:**
     - Store sensitive information like database credentials.
     - Access secrets programmatically through Azure SDKs.
   - **Certificate Management:**
     - Import and manage SSL/TLS certificates.
     - Configure auto-renewal for certificates.

#### **6. Enable Soft Delete and Purge Protection**
   - Enable soft delete in Azure Key Vault to recover deleted keys, secrets, or certificates.
   - Configure purge protection to prevent permanent deletion.

#### **7. Integrate Azure Key Vault with Other Azure Services**
   - Use Key Vault to store secrets for Azure App Service and Azure Functions.
   - Integrate Key Vault with Azure Virtual Machines to encrypt data disks.

#### **8. Test and Validate Security Implementation**
   - Test the encryption and decryption process using managed keys.
   - Validate key, secret, and certificate access through logs and audits.
   - Simulate scenarios for soft delete and recovery.

#### **9. Document and Present Findings**
   - Create a report summarizing the implementation steps, challenges, and outcomes.
   - Include screenshots and diagrams where applicable.
   - Present findings to stakeholders or peers.

### **Sample Code Snippets**

#### **Create an Azure Key Vault Using Azure CLI**
```bash
az keyvault create --name MyKeyVault \
  --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
  --location eastus \
  --sku standard
```

#### **Add a Secret to Key Vault**
```bash
az keyvault secret set --vault-name MyKeyVault \
  --name MySecret \
  --value "MySecretValue"
```

#### **Enable Soft Delete and Purge Protection**
```bash
az keyvault update --name MyKeyVault \
  --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
  --enable-soft-delete true \
  --enable-purge-protection true
```

#### **Access Secrets Programmatically Using Python**
```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient

# Set up client
key_vault_name = "MyKeyVault"
KVUri = f"https://{key_vault_name}.vault.azure.net"
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = SecretClient(vault_url=KVUri, credential=credential)

# Retrieve a secret
retrieved_secret = client.get_secret("MySecret")
print(f"Retrieved secret: {retrieved_secret.value}")
```
